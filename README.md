# Menu Toolkit

Menu Toolkit provides functionality to help create accessible and usable menus. Toolkit provides JavaScript functions to create the menu and it's up to you to style it and extend it.

## Menu from HTML

**Demos**

* ["Click" interaction](https://evermade.github.io/menu-toolkit/)
* ["Hover" interaction](https://evermade.github.io/menu-toolkit/hover.html)
* [Animating sub menus](https://evermade.github.io/menu-toolkit/animation.html)

Function `menuFromHTML` adds accessible enhancements and events for WordPress navigation menus (although you can use it for different menus).

Two different interaction modes are supported:

1. `click`: sub menus are opened only on click
2. `hover`: sub menus open also with hover

Things to note:

* This function only handles the `<ul>` part of your menu. You may need additional logic for example toggles or displaying mobile menu in modal
* It's recommended to have separate menu markup for mobile menu at least when hover is used (and regardless often different configuration makes sense for smaller screens)
* This is not plug-and-play library and you still need to properly style the menu

### Usage

If youâ€™re using a bundler (such as Webpack or Rollup), you can install through npm:

```bash
npm install @evermade/menu-toolkit
```

Import the `menuFromHTML` and create a menu.

```js
import { menuFromHTML } from "@evermade/menu-toolkit";

const menuEl = document.querySelector('.js-main-menu');
if (menuEl) {
	const menu = menuFromHTML(
		menuEl,
		{
			action: 'click'
		}
	);
}
```

### Markup

In general it's recommended to wrap the menu in `<nav>` element but we'll show just the parts this function needs.

```html
<ul class="js-main-menu">
	<li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
	<li class="menu-item-has-children">
		<a href="#">Work</a>
		<ul class="sub-menu">
			<li><a href="/websites">Websites</a></li>
			<li><a href="/e-commerce">E-commerce</a></li>
			<li><a href="/apps">Apps</a></li>
	</li>
	<li class="menu-item-has-children">
		<a href="#">Services</a>
		<ul class="sub-menu">
			<li><a href="/design">Design</a></li>
			<li><a href="/development">Development</a></li>
			<li class="menu-item-has-children">
				<a href="#">Care</a>
				<ul class="sub-menu">
					<li><a href="/upkeep">Upkeep</a></li>
					<li><a href="/monitoring">Monitoring</a></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
</ul>
```

### Changes to markup

This functions adds toggles to open/close menus.

Before:

```html
<li class="menu-item-has-children">
	<a href="/services">Services</a>
</li>
```

After (if `shouldWrapAnchorToButton` is true):

```html
<li class="menu-item-has-children">
	<a href="/services" hidden>Services</a>
	<button aria-expanded="false" data-toggle-type="cover">
		<span>Services</span>
		<svg></svg>
	</button>
</li>
```

After (if `shouldWrapAnchorToButton` is false):

```html
<li class="menu-item-has-children">
	<a href="/services">Services</a>
	<button aria-expanded="false" data-toggle-type="icon">
		<span class="screen-reader-text">Sub menu</span>
		<svg></svg>
	</button>
</li>
```

### Functional CSS

There's much more you'll actually need but here's functional things that you need so that opening and closing sub menus work:

```CSS
[hidden] {
	display: none !important;
}

.sub-menu {
	opacity: 0;
	pointer-events: none;
	visibility: hidden;
}

.sub-menu.is-open {
	opacity: 1;
	visibility: visible;
	pointer-events: auto;
}
```

Tips and tricks:

* It's recommended not to open sub menus with `:hover` because hovering will already add `is-open` class to sub menu
* You can use selctors for toggles: `[data-toggle-type="cover"]` and `[data-toggle-type="icon"]`
* You probably want to have all the same styling for `[data-toggle-type="cover"]` than for `<a>`
* If you use animation you can do CSS animations or just transition with `.sub-menu.animate-open` and `.sub-menu.animate-close` (or whatever classes you configure)
* If you want to animate caret without delay of animation you can target it with `[data-toggle-type="cover"][aria-expanded="true"]` because aria-expanded is updated without any delay
* Remember to check that you have proper `:focus` style in place for both `<a>` and `<button>` elements

### Options

There are many settings (in object format) that can be passed as 2nd argument with following types:

		'<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><path d="M17.5 11.6L12 16l-5.5-4.4.9-1.2L12 14l4.5-3.6 1 1.2z"></path></svg>',
	shouldWrapAnchorToButton: null,
